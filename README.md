# EarthQuake_Reports_Live_App
This app shhows recent earthquake activities from around the world with help f USGS api. It parses geojson data and then shows to user.

What I learned-

a) Use of AsyncTask class to start a background thread.

b) json paring

c) use of api to extract data

Note- This app was created during online course on UDACITY.
